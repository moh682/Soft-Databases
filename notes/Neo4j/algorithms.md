## Algorithms for Graph databases

### Types of algorithm types
- Central Computation
- Comunity detection
- Similarity
- Path-finding and search

**Central Computation**
These form of algorthims are used to determine the important nodes in a network.


**Comunity Detection**
These algorithms are used to find sub-graphs in bigger graphs.

**Similarity**
Find Similarities based on connections

**Path-Finding and Search**
- Finds the shortest path: A traverse route with the fewet hops between two nodes. 
- Average path: *Average distance between nodes*
- Diameter of graph: *The longest shortest path between all nodes*
