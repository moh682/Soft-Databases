## Neo4j 

Neo4j is under the category of graph databases, because it stores databases as a graph (in the mathematical sense). 
This database is known for being whitebord friendly because virtually any diagram you draw on databases can be stored in neo4j.
Neo4j focuses on relations more than commonalities among set of values (such as collections of documents or tables of rows).
Neo4j is small enough to be embedded in any application and on the other hand it can run in multiple clusters and contain billions of nodes, and as many relationships.
