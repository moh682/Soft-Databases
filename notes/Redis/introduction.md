# Introduction to Redis

### Redis 
Redis is as its founder Salvatore Sanfilippo (aka antirez) refers, a "data structure server". It is hard to specify exactly what redis is. At a base level its a key-value store, but id does not do it justice, because redis is more than that. Redis supports advanced data structures, but not to the same degree as a documented-oriented database.

### Purpose
It can have multiple purposes. I will mension some of them below
- Blocking queue
- Publish-Subscribe system.

- trades durability for fast performance
- Set based queries with no granulation or type support
- Configurable expiry policies
