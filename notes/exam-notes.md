# Sample DB Questions, SOFT 2020 Spring

## All Database Types

### 1. Explain the following terms: data, information, database, and database management system. What is the difference? Give examples.

**Data**: is all the single items that are stored in the database.
**Information**: is meaningfull processed data. just simple data rows without proccessing is not meaningfull data.
**Database**: Database is an organized collection of data.
**Database management system**: DBMS is a system that helps managing the dabatase.

### 2. What is called a database schema? Which databases enable enforcing a hard schema, which are schemaless, and which enable storing semi-structured data?

#### What is.

**Database Schema**: Database schemas are the bone structure for any table and databases. it defined how the data is organized and how relations among them are assosiated.
**Hard Schema**: hard schema also called strict schema. Databases that uses them cannot take data that does not comply with the schema and willr eturn an error.
**Schemmaless**: is dynamic data structure, meaning the data inserted does not have nessesarily have to be on a specific type.

#### Who enables storing semi-structured Data?

Semi-structure is a structure where it does not have a rigid or a fixed structure. The structure is discovered from the data.

### 3. Explain the difference between logical data model and underlying physical data storage organisation. Give examples for some of the databases you are familiar with.

**Logical Data Model**
Logical Data model is a fully attributed data model used to describe the data we are working as a business perspektive and not without the technical part.

**Physical Data Model**
Physical data model is also a fully attributed data model. It is used after the logic Data model have been made. But instead of just have the data seperated in their respective containers. we insert them into a diagram related to the Database we are going to use. with more specific information to guide the technical aspect of the application.

### 4. What is called a database transaction? Which are the main properties of a transaction? Explain ACID properties.

##### ACID Rules

ACID which stands for Atomic Consistent Isolated Durability, is about insuring the data remaining consistance despite any failures.

**Atomic**
Atmoicity means guaranteeing thatx either everything succeed or nothing does

**Consistency**
This isures that the data is consitent in the transactions.

**Isolation**
This mean that current transactions are not effected by other transactions, like in deadlocks or updates.

**Durability**
This mean after the transaction has succeeded the result would remain in the system permanently.

### 5. Explain the concurrency problem in database implementation and the techniques for controlling it. How does it relate to transaction management and isolation? Which are the basic transaction isolation levels?

When multiple transactions happen uninrestricted, problems called concurrency problems may occur. The problems are seperated into four different categories.

**Dirty Read Problem**
**Unrepeatable Read Problem**
**Lost Update Problem**
**Phantom Read Problem**

### 6. What is the purpose of indexing the database? How do indices operate? Give some examples of guidance rules of indexing.

Indexing is a way of optimizing the database read performance.

When data is stored in a structure close to something similiar to a linked list. where the data is not sorted, it is required to go through the data linearly. Which will make location and accessing a database slow. To optimize it. we use indexing

### 7. How to ensure high quality of database model and validate a database? Name some validation techniques. Give examples of validation against user transactions?

Adding Security, Precautions for unexpected failures like electricity shortage like ACID. implement normalization and denormalization when possible.

```diff
- IS STIL NEEDED
```

### 8. Name some criteria for database operations performance. How to estimate the cost of an operation? Name some techniques for performance optimization.

Query Processing -> the activities involved in parsing, validating, optimzing and executing a query.

<img src="../images/query_optimization.png"/>

**SQL Query** -> the statement
**Parser**:
syntax check. -> check for syntax error.
semantic check. -> Check if the sentence is meaningfull, like if the database/table exist.

**hard parsing** ->  
**soft parsing** ->

Techniques for performance optimization:

- Query optimization
- Indexing
- Heuritics

### 9. What is called transaction log, what does it contain and how to use it?

transaction log is a log used by databases to guarentee ACID. By checking the log after a fatal failure, anc check for uncomitted task and then rollback. And The one that have been committed but not materielized will be reapplied.

Log contain:

- Log sequence number LSN
- Prev Log Sequence number PLSN
- Transaction ID
- Type of log record
- About actual change that triggered the log.

### 10. Explain the scope of data security and protection. Name some major security threads. Describe approaches and measures of securing a database. Name some hardware methods of data protection.

**Database is threads**

- Theft and fraud
- Loss of confidentiality
- Loss of privacy
- Loss of integrity
- Loss og availability

**Protection Measures**

- Authnetication
- Authorization
- Access controls
- Views
- Encryption
- Backup and recovery
- Integrity
- RAID Technology

Hardware Measures

- Storing redundant components which can replace the damage parts. Expensive but still an option.
- RAID, Redundant array of independent disks.

**RAID**
This is also used for protecting the whole data. by seperating the data into different disks. If something happens to a single disk we would not lose all the data.

- Data striping
- Parity controll

Data striping
is used for performance, by adding/recieving data concurrently. Its faster than the read/write of the single disk.

Parity control
check wether the data ends with an even or an uneven number. based on that number we know if the collected data from the partitions are missing or not, and it will be handled appropriately based on that.

### 11. What is the meaning of the CAP theorem? How does it differ from the ACID rules?

**CAP Theorem**

- Consistency
- Availabilty
- Partition Tolerance

Cap theorem is not about choosing a combination between Consistensy, partitions or avalability. Its actually about choosing between concistency or availability in an invironment that have partition tolerance.

Consistency -> making sure all the partition are synced with one another
Availabilty -> is available under any surcomstances.

### 12. Explain how to choose an appropriate database type for an application.

### 19. What is the meaning of functional dependency? Explain the implementation of it. Give examples. How does it relate to database normalization?

Functional dependancy is when one attribute determine another attribute.
types of functional dependancy:

- **Trivial** -> X -> Y is a trivial functional dependency if Y is a subset of X.
- **Multi-valued** -> In this example, maf_year and color are independent of each other but dependent on car_model. In this example, these two columns are said to be multivalue dependent on car_model

**Type: Graph-Oriented Database**

Matrix model.
every vertex have a relation to another vertex via a relationship called edge. In relational databases we have yo create a seperate table to insert the relations between the nodes. Matrix is much faster at retrieve finding a vertexs edges than a relational database can with tables. because it point directly to another vertex.
