## Exam Description
In the modern IT world, many businesses provide their products or services on-line, using Internet as achannel of communication with their customers. During economically hard times as Corona isolation for many it remains the only platform for marketing and retailing.

To meet the requirements of the on-line digital transition, modern applications work with purpose-built and decoupled data stores, where different application components can be mapped to different data sources, rather than to a single database. This approach is implemented in microservices architecture, as well as in polyglot persistence applications.


## Project Objective
Your objective is to provide, as a prove of concept, database support to an application or related
applications, where multiple diverse database models are built and implemented for different purposes.
